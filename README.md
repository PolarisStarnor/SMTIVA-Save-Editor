# SMTIVA-Save-Editor

A save editor for Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse, uses addresses from the preexisting one by Waynelimt (https://github.com/waynelimt/SMT_IV_Save_Editor), along with a more up-to-date list of skills from a cheat table by The Black X (https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=16219).

It's just a scuffed terminal based editor really, I wanted demon replacement so I could copy those youtube videos you'd see with the Messiahs fighting whatever boss fight.

Installation: None as long as Python 3.0 is installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
