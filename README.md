# SMTIVA-Save-Editor
A save editor for Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse. Uses addresses stored in a cheat table by The Black X (https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=16219).

It's just a scuffed terminal based editor really. I wanted demon replacement function so I could copy those youtube videos you'd see with the Messiahs fighting whatever boss fight, and this is the result.

Installation: None as long as Python 3.0 is installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Using the Save Editor itself should be intuitive enough. Though you should have the source code open for Demons and Skills because those functions accept the Hex Code as input.
